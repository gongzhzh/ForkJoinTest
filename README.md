#Description:
We designed and implemented a parallel version of a sequential search algorithm using the Fork/Join. The goal of the search is to find a goal inside a maze taking advantage of parallelism.

#How we implement:
To implement the method, we have to acknowledge that the compute() function is part of the Fork/Join framework, and it recursively invokes fork() and join() to execute subtasks in parallel.

#The key logic in  parallelSearch() of compute():
We start with an initial note and explore the maze by moving the player to the top node in the frontier list. 
With each move, the player will check the neighboring nodes:
If the player is not reaching the goal, we let the current thread keep exploring via the first neighbor (save the cost by avoiding extra forks), and then we fork the other neighbors. 
Once the player reaches the goal, we terminate and return the path of the recursion. At the same time, all parallel forks will be terminated by the hasFoundGoal flag and traced back to their child fork to merge the path. 

#Shared information:
To ensure the plays only explore new nodes in the maze instead of the visited path, we used a thread-safe data structure, ConcurrentSkipListSet, to store all visited notes.
To store and trace all threads, we used a CopyOnWriteArrayList, a thread-safe data structure, to store all forks.
Once a thread finds the goal, all threads need to terminate and start to join other threads. So we used an AtomicBoolean to record this state.
